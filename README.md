My personal website <em>Being updated as of Fall '17</em>

This was created during <strong>Summer '17</strong> as my own summer project. I wanted to design my own website because I wanted to create a living and more responsive version of my resume. It is definitely more appealing to users, plus it allowed me learn so much more about development during the time that I designed and coded this portfolio website. I used various online resources such as YouTube videos, articles and guides to assist me in the process.

Another version of the website will be launched in the end of Fall '17 to incorporate additional changes such as:
<ul>
    <li>Better responsiveness</li>
