My personal website

This was created during <strong>Summer '17</strong> as my own summer project. I wanted to design my own website because I wanted to create a living and more responsive version of my resume. It is definitely more appealing to users, plus it allowed me learn so much more about development during the time that I designed and coded this portfolio website. I used various online resources such as YouTube videos, articles and guides to assist me in the process.
